                                We are not only looking for novel ideas and concepts, we are also particular about advancing existing technological ideas and concepts. Projects for submission might be on or beyond the conceptual stage and have a team committed to the vision.
                                The project must have a working capital around the prize money - N 1,000,000 for funding for your business so that we can have a true impact on helping you grow.

                            Applicants are selected based on their business idea, team member’s skills and background, and the team’s ability to execute. We also consider whether our partnering innovation hubs can have an impact on their 
                            success and growth as part of the selection process. Unlike prior year(s), you do not have to have a team member with a learning difference to qualify, but we certainly do think teams with diverse brain-types 
                            can build the greatest companies.

                            Not necessarily, but a mentor will be assigned to the finalists coming for the grand finale. The mentor will prepare their assigned team on how to go about their preparations which includes; Comportment and Pitch delivery.

                            That said, we have found that many people starting companies have gaps in their knowledge that they need to fill to become successful entrepreneurs. The mentorship sessions are designed to fill these gaps in a laser-focused way matched to your needs. 
                            They are not like business school classes that simply survey a topic. These sessions are tactical based upon the needs of the attendees.
